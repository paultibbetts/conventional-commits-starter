# Conventional Commits Starter

[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

This package sets up [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to run [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) when you type `git commit` so you can write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

On installation it will copy a `.huskyrc` file into your project's root directory for you to add your own git hooks.
